# Main Research Project

## Learning Objectives

 -  Develop topical expertise in a domain that relates to human factors
 -  Research topic and summarize topic
 -  Analyze and interpret trends
 -  Identify and describe human factors related issues
 -  Explore potential opportunities or problem areas (e.g. pedestrian fatalities at all time high) (human-, market-driven, or both)
 -  Based on topical expertise (do one or more of these)
     -  Identify research gaps and develop a research curriculum
     -  Envision and conceptualize potential innovation(s) in the topical domain
     -  Forecast future trends and paradigm shifts

Intent is to allow students to students select a domain that furthers their career interests. Those students pursuing a PhD are strongly encouraged to develop a research driven project (e.g. essential something that could be adapted to a proposal or academic research project).

In all cases the project needs to be largely an individual effort in its core HF related areas. If a project is conducted with the assistance of others, the individuals’ contributions need to be clearly stated and identified. Please disclose assistance from artifical and human intelligence agents.

### Grading assistant Prompt for GPT4

I plan on experimentally using ChatGPT to assist with assessing your assignments to enhance my efficiency, 
objectivity, and potentially the quality of your feedback. This is the prompt I plan on using.

 I need you to review the assignment and the rubric. I will provide you an assignment to review. You will use your
expertise of Human Factors Psychology to grade the assignment against the rubic. Please provide a letter grade for
each criteria (F, D, C, B-, B, B+, A-, A, A+). Respond with "Ready for assignment" if you understand.

```

#### Notes 

- Upload assignment as PDF. If the text is copied into the prompt it will likely truncate the assignment.
- ChatGPT-3.5 might provides lower letter grades than ChatGPT-4 and is not-consistent (would not recommend using 3.5).
- The assessments from ChatGPT-4 will be used as supplemental information for grading.
- The use of ChatGPT-4 as a grading assistant is experimental.
- I will provide ChatGPT's feedback to you
